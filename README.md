# This project contains functions created for a project on ODE and PDE solvers.
# In the ODE solvers, I use the Explicit Euler method and RK4 to solve ODEs,
# which are able to solve any order of ODE. I then work through numerical
# shooting and numerical continuation where I have incorporated both into
# the one numerical continuation file. On the PDE side, I have written up
# four PDE solvers which use the Implicit Euler method, the Explicit Euler 
# method, the Crank Nicolson method and the RK4 method. These PDE solvers use
# the PDEDiagMat.py file to construct the problem and then run through it
# in the PDESolvers.py file.
